## <a id = "installation"> 4. ðŸš€ Installation and launch </a>

To ensure proper functioning, Redis must be installed

In the Installation on Windows section, it's better to mention that Microsoft has discontinued support for Redis, and it's recommended to use WSL2 or Docker instead.

### 4.1 Installation on Windows
For Windows, it is recommended to install Redist.msi [GitHub for install Redis](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases)

### 4.2 Installation on Linux

Follow the instructions in the terminal described on the [official site](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-linux/)



It is recommended to install the port corresponding to SpeedTest - 6379 in the installer
If port 6379 is busy, then in the file `appsettings.json`(path - `SpeedTest\Web\appsettings.json`) replace the port with the one specified during installation
```sh 
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Redis": "localhost:YOUR_HOST"
}
```

### Requests to check the cache contents after launching the application

```sh
KEYS server-city:* #Getting all cached cities
```

```sh
GET server-city:your_city #Getting the contents of your_city
```

### 4.3 Configuring the Desktop application

If the Desktop application is not working, it may be due to a port mismatch, check which port the backend application is running on (by default it should work on 5252) and replace it in the Desktop file `Settings.settings` path `SpeedTest\Desktop\Properties\Settings.settings`

```sh

# Replace YOUR_PORT to the backend launch port

<Setting Name="SpeedTestUri" Type="System.String" Scope="Application">
      <Value Profile="(Default)">http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/SpeedTest/</Value>
    </Setting>
    <Setting Name="LocationUri" Type="System.String" Scope="Application">
      <Value Profile="(Default)">http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api/Location/</Value>
    </Setting>
```
